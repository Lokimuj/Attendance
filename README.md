# User Guide
## When creating a new file:
1. Click on New File in the Main window
2. Click CS1 default in the New File window to populate the days.

   If you want to use this window manually, it's essentially a stack. You can click any of the recitation numbers to get rid of them, but 
   submitting new ones always goes at the end. If this inconvenient let me know, but I figured no one would want anything but the default.
3. Click submit.

   After the window closes you should see the days bar appear in the main window.
4. Click on Add Students in the Main window
5. Enter the relative path to the mycourses file into the bottom text box in the Add Students window.
6. Click read students.

   After a second all the students should be read in and the program ready to use.
(Optional) 7. Click SAVE AS... in the Main window, enter the file name you want and save it so that from now on you can just click SAVE to save your file.

## Loading in a file
1. Click on LOAD in the main window
2. Type in the relative path to your Attendance file
3. Click load

## Taking attendance
1. Make sure you have a roster loaded in through either of the two above processes.
2. The rows are students and the columns are recitations/days (with CS1 Default these should match up to the week numbers).
3. For whichever day you want to do, go down the column of tiles clicking X to denote 'Absent', N to denote 'present without computer', and C to denote 'present with computer'.
   
   All attendance details start in the Absent state unless read in from a save file.
   
## Pairing up
1. Click the purple 'pairs' button for the day you want
2. Absent students will not appear on the new window, even if you change their attendance while the window is open. Close and reopen the pairs window for those updates to appear.
3. If you'd like to manually pair students, you can click on a student's box to select them, then click another student and they'll be paired.
4. If you want to automatically pair them, click the pair up button.

   This pairs students randomly, prioritizing pairing students with no computer with those that do have a computer.
5. If you want to change a pair, click its unpair button and the students will be split back into individual tiles, available to be paired up again.
  
   All pair information for each day is persistent through saving and loading files, so pair information is available in case it's needed at some point for some reason
   Also updates to pair data are made immediately upon any action in the pair window, so no worries about forgetting to save your changes.
